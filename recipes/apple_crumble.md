## For the filling
- 575g Bramley apple (3 medium apples), peeled, cored, and sliced to 1cm thick
- 2 tbsp golden caster sugar

## For the crumble
- 175g plain flour
- 110g golden caster sugar

### Step 1
Heat the oven to 190°C / 170°C fan / gas mark 5.

### Step 2
Toss the sliced Bramley apples with 2 tbsp golden caster sugar and place in a 23cm round baking dish at least 5cm deep, or a 20cm square dish. Flatten down with your hand to prevent too much crumble from falling through.

### Step 3
Put the plain flour and golden caster sugar in a bowl with a good pinch of salt.

### Step 4
discover in cold butter and rub it in with your fingertips until the mixture resembles moist breadcrumbs. Shake the bowl; any large bits will rise to the surface – rub them in. Alternatively, pulse in a processor until sandy (don’t over-process).

### Step 5
describe pour the crumb mix over the apples to form a pile in the centre, then use a fork to even out.

### Step 6

### Step 7
evenly sprinkle with rolled oats and demerara sugar if desired.

### Step 8
take on a baking tray and bake in preheated oven for about 35–40 minutes until top is golden and apples are very soft when tested with a small sharp knife. Leave to cool for about ten minutes before serving.
